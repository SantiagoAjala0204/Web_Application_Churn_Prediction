# Web_Application_Churn_Prediction
This repository contains the code and requirements for deploying a web application for predicting customer turnover in a company.

# Execution of Web Application

To run the web application, you need to install the following requirements:
```python
streamlit
seaborn
matplotlib
pandas
numpy
joblib
plotly
scikit-learn
```

 The next step is to download the models from the following link: [“Link_Models”](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/180MNuiBrpfTtyTF5-dmcwZQXJQ-hdyo-?usp=sharing) and place them in the same directory where the files are located.

To deploy the web application, run the following code: 
```python
streamlit run main.py
```
Finally, you will be able to view the application in your web browser and select the model you want to use to make predictions, either using all features or the main features.
